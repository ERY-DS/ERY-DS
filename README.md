You are here!
Here is where you can get both a look and a feel of the data analytics projects I have done. They are safer here!
Each Repository is to each project. The 'readme' file in each repository gives you a summary of what the project is about.
If you are impressed with my journey and skills. We can take it a step further by reaching out through my mail - estherbadejo@ymail.com 
I am open to work with you on any route (remote, hybrid, on-site, full-time, visa-sponsorship, freelance etc)
Do have a good time!
